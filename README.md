# game-setup-bot
Discord bot for managing LAN game setups.

# Current Ideas for the Bot:
- Link game setups to individual Discord IDs for easy availability on who can bring setups
- Ability to mass ping people per-game for different events/LANS
    - Schedule these pings
- Automatic management of game roles per person
- Presets for specific setups which enables quick configurations for new users (consoles, laptops, etc)
- Add accessories such as adaptors, controllers, monitors, cables, etc
- Create a custom backup chat that is read only, which can be updated as an offline backup in case of a bot outage
    - Also applicable to avoid constant use of bot commands, can just check the #setups chat
- Plug into IGDB API in order to have easy access to game titles, also add custom titles
